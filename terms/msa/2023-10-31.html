below) and Whimsical, Inc., a Delaware corporation with a place of business at 1630 Welton Street, 7<sup>th</sup> Floor, Denver, Colorado 80202 USA (“<strong>Whimsical</strong>”), which govern Customer’s and its Affiliates’ access to and use of Whimsical’s Services. Whimsical and Customer may individually be referred to as a “party” and collectively “the parties”. The Agreement is effective as of the date that you sign up for the Services online or submit an Order Form that references this Agreement (the “<strong>Effective Date</strong>”). This Agreement includes and incorporates the Order Form, if applicable, and any exhibits thereto, the Policies, and (as applicable) any DPA or other agreement related to the Services and executed by the parties. In the event of a conflict between the Order Form and this Agreement, the Order Form shall control. There shall be no force or effect to any different terms of any related purchase order or similar form even if signed by the parties after the date hereof.</p><p>By accepting this Agreement, either by clicking a box indicating your acceptance, executing an Order Form or other document that references this Agreement, by using (or making any payment for) the Services, or by otherwise indicating your acceptance of this Agreement, you: (1) agree to this Agreement on behalf of the customer indicated on the Order Form (if applicable) or the organization, business, or other legal entity for which you act (“<strong>Customer</strong>,” “<strong>you</strong>,” or “<strong>your</strong>”); and (2) represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind Customer to this Agreement. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and may not use the Services.</p><p>Many organizations, such as businesses, use Whimsical’s Services. If you are accessing or using the Services on behalf of an organization, business, or other legal entity (an “<strong>Organization</strong>”) then your Organization is legally and financially responsible for your access to and use of the Services as well as for the use of your Whimsical account by others affiliated with the Organization, including any employees, agents, or contractors. For the avoidance of doubt, the Organization for which you act will be considered the “Customer” under this Agreement. Further, if a Workspace is created by an Administrator that uses an Organization email and such Workspace maintains an Administrator whose account uses an Organization email, that Organization, subject to such Organization having the necessary subscription plan and prior notice to relevant Users, may gain access to account information associated with such Workspace or may claim control and ownership of such Workspace.

When Customer’s Administrator claims such Workspace, Customer acknowledges that it assumes all rights and obligations associated with that Workspace, including the obligation to pay Fees for any additional Users resulting from such claimed Workspace. If Customer uses the Services’ domain management functionality, Customer agrees that it is responsible for ensuring that Customer’s use complies with all applicable laws and any internal policies, including those involving employee privacy. If Whimsical reasonably suspects that Customer or Customer Data are in violation of the foregoing, Whimsical may investigate that violation and suspend or terminate Customer’s access to the Services.</p><p><strong>2.4 Whimsical AI</strong>.

As defined in FAR section 2.101, the Services and documentation are “commercial items” and according to DFAR section 252.227-7014(a)(1) and (5) are deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation.” Consistent with DFAR section 227.7202 and FAR section 12.212, any use modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such commercial software or commercial software documentation by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by the terms of this Agreement and will be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement. </p><p><strong>3.3</strong> Customer represents, covenants, and warrants that Customer will use the Services only in compliance with Whimsical’s Policies, this Agreement, the Documentation, and all applicable laws and regulations. Customer further represents, covenants, and warrants that to the extent Customer’s subscription to the Services provides access to, and Whimsical provides, domain matching as described in Section 2.3, Customer (a) has the right, power, and authority to request and obtain the email addresses of Customer’s Users, (b) Customer is the owner of the domain associated with such Customer Users’ email addresses, and (c) Customer’s use of such domain matching functionality will not violate, and will not cause Whimsical to violate, any applicable laws or privacy policies or data privacy rights of Customer Users or any third party.</p><p><strong>3.4</strong> Customer will not, and will not permit Users to, share User account credentials, or use them in multiple locations at the same time.

Whimsical may update its Security Policy to reflect current practices, but in no event will Whimsical decrease the level of security described in the Security Policy as of the date of this Agreement. Furthermore, Whimsical will protect Customer Data in accordance with its Privacy Notice.</p><h3>4. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION; PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</h3><p><strong>4.1</strong> Each party (the “Receiving Party”) shall protect the Confidential Information of the other party (the “Disclosing Party”) using the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information (but not less than reasonable care).  The Receiving Party shall (a) not use or disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose except as necessary in performance of its obligations under this Agreement or as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, and (b) limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its employees and contractors who have a need to know such Confidential Information for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who have signed confidentiality agreements with the Receiving Party containing protections not materially less protective of the Confidential Information than those herein.  Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is made generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement or of any existing confidentiality obligations governing such information; (ii) is developed by the Receiving Party independently from and without reference to the Confidential Information; (iii) is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party without restriction; or (iv) was in the Receiving Party’s lawful possession prior to disclosure and was not obtained by the Receiving Party either directly or indirectly from the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party’s obligations under this Section 4.1 shall survive termination and continue for five (5) years from the date of termination of this Agreement. All Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party. Upon termination, the Receiving Party shall cease any use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. Upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy all documents and tangible materials containing Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and provide a signed document attesting to such return or destruction. If Receiving Party is required by law or court order to disclose Confidential Information, then Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permitted, provide Disclosing Party with advance written notice and cooperate in any effort to obtain confidential treatment of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p><p><strong>4.2</strong> Whimsical and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in all intellectual property rights, including patent, trademark, trade name and copyright, whether registered or not registered, in and to the Services, the Documentation, and the underlying technology thereof, and any derivative works, modifications, or improvements of any of the foregoing. Whimsical also owns all aggregated and anonymized statistical and performance information related to the provision and operation of the Services, and Customer understands that such information is inherent to, and necessary for, Whimsical’s provision of the Services. Whimsical reserves all rights in the Services not expressly granted herein, and no other license or implied rights of any kind are granted or conveyed.  “Whimsical” and associated logos are the registered trademarks or trademarks of Whimsical. This Agreement does not permit Customer to use any Whimsical trademarks.</p><p><strong>4.3 </strong>Customer shall own all right, title and interest in and to the Customer Data, as well as any data that is based on or derived from the Customer Data and provided to Customer as part of the Services.

PAYMENT OF FEES</h3><p><strong>5.1</strong> Customer will pay Whimsical the then-applicable fees described in the Order Form for the Services in accordance with the terms therein (the “<strong>Fees</strong>”). If Customer’s use of the Services exceeds the Services Capacity set forth on the Order Form or otherwise requires the payment of additional fees (per the terms of this Agreement), Customer shall be billed for such usage and Customer agrees to pay the additional fees in the manner provided herein. Whimsical reserves the right to change the Fees or applicable charges and to institute new charges and Fees at the end of the Subscription Term or then-current renewal term, upon 30 days prior notice to Customer (which may be sent by email). If Customer believes that Whimsical has billed Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact Whimsical no later than 60 days after the closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared in order to receive an adjustment or credit. Inquiries should be directed to Whimsical’s customer support department. Whimsical does not accept payment via physical check.</p><p><strong>5.2 </strong>Whimsical may choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full payment for invoices issued in any given month must be received by Whimsical 30 days after the mailing date of the invoice. Unpaid amounts are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in immediate termination of Services. Customer shall be responsible for all taxes associated with Services (without any offset or deduction to the fees paid to Whimsical), other than U.S. taxes based on Whimsical’s net income, and Customer may not reduce the fees payable to Whimsical as a result of taxes.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>6. SUBSCRIPTION TERM; TERMINATION</strong></p><p><strong>6.1 Subscription Term</strong>. The Subscription Term Start Date shall be identified in the Order Form. For any renewal, the start date of the Subscription Term shall be the date immediately following the end date of the previous Subscription Term. The Subscription Term shall only renew with the mutual written agreement of the parties.</p><p><strong>6.2 Termination. </strong>This Agreement, and Customer’s rights to use the Services, shall terminate immediately if: (a) there is no active Subscription Term; (b) a party materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days from the date of such party’s written notice to the other party, (c) a party seeks protection under any bankruptcy or similar proceeding and such proceeding is not dismissed within 60 days; or (d) Customer fails to pay Fees due hereunder. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Services may not be cancelled or terminated by Customer during the Subscription Term and Customer will pay in full for the Services up to and including the last day on which the Services are provided. </p><p><strong>6.3 Effect of Termination</strong>.  Upon expiration or termination of any Subscription Term: (a) Whimsical will make all Customer Data available to Customer for electronic retrieval for a period of 30 days; (b) Whimsical will delete stored Customer Data within 90 days; and (c) Customer shall promptly: (i) discontinue all use of the Services, and (ii) pay all Fees due during the Subscription Term, <em>provided</em>, <em>however</em>, that if Customer terminates the Services for Whimsical’s uncured breach, then (1) Customer shall pay all Fees due for the Services up to the effective date of termination, and/or (2) Customer will receive a prorated refund of amounts pre-paid to Whimsical for Customer’s use of the Services for the remainder of the Subscription Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts pre-paid through the effective date of termination are final and non-refundable.

CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 7.1, WHIMSICAL MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES. WHIMSICAL IS FURNISHING THE WARRANTY SET FORTH IN SECTION 7.1 IN LIEU OF, AND WHIMSICAL HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDES, ANY AND ALL OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER UNDER COMMON LAW, STATUTE OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AS TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS.

INDEMNITY</h3><p><strong>8.1 Indemnification by Whimsical.</strong> If any action is instituted by a third party against Customer based upon a claim that the Services, as delivered, infringe any United States patent or copyright or misappropriates any trade secret, Whimsical shall indemnify and hold Customer harmless with respect to such action.

THIS SECTION SETS FORTH THE ENTIRE OBLIGATION OF WHIMSICAL AND THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF CUSTOMER AGAINST WHIMSICAL FOR ANY CLAIM THAT THE SERVICES INFRINGE A THIRD PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</p><p><strong>8.2 Indemnification by Customer</strong>. Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Whimsical harmless from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to any claim brought by a third party arising out of or related to (a) Customer’s or its Users, employees, consultants, and/or contractors breach of this Agreement or failure to comply with its obligations hereunder; or (b) a claim with respect to Customer Data and/or alleged infringement or misappropriation of third-party’s intellectual property rights arising from Customer Data. </p><p><strong>8.3 Procedure.</strong> The obligations under this Section 8 are subject to the party seeking indemnity or reimbursement hereunder (the “<strong>Indemnified Party</strong>”) notifying the other party (the “<strong>Indemnifying Party</strong>”) promptly in writing of such claim, giving the Indemnifying Party sole control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations, and cooperating and assisting in such defense at the Indemnifying Party’s reasonable request and expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent if the settlement would require the Indemnified Party to (a) pay any amounts, or (b) require the Indemnified Party to make an admission of wrongdoing or fault.  Nothing in this Section 8 prohibits the Indemnified Party from participating in the defense of any claim at its own expense.   </p><h3>9.
